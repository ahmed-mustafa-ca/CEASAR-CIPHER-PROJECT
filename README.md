# 🔐 Caesar Cipher in Python

A **Caesar Cipher tool** built with Python to **encrypt and decrypt messages** like ancient spies! 🕵️‍♂️⚔️

## 🚀 Features

* ✨ **Encrypt**: Scramble plain text using a shift value.
* 🔍 **Decrypt**: Unscramble text back to its original form.
* 🔄 Alphabet letters shift with wrap-around (A → D, B → E, … Z → C).
* 📝 Works with any custom shift value.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Python**
* String manipulation & loops

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helped practice:

* String handling in Python
* Loops & conditional logic
* Basics of **cryptography** and classical ciphers

## 📂 How It Works

1. Run the script.
2. Choose **encrypt** or **decrypt**.
3. Enter your message and a **shift value**.
4. Get the encrypted or decrypted text instantly!

## 🔜 Next Steps

* Add **brute-force decryption** (try all shifts automatically).
* Build a simple **GUI** for a more interactive experience.

## 💡 Inspiration

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest encryption methods—simple but powerful.
This project is a fun way to explore **cryptography basics** while improving Python skills.
